"Before you start planning a solution, know the problem. " This is a sentence that I like the most in the article. It reminds me of a story of my uncle's friend, who is also a web developer. He has created a website that contains all kinds of information, such as travel, foods, jobs, and news. However, there are few visitors to his website. He thought the reason why his site is not successful is that it does not look attractive enough, so he spent years to make this website look fancy. However, after the updates, the number of visitors still did not increase. I think his problem is that he did not clarify the problem before working on solving it. Actually, the problem is that the website has so much information that it does not focus on any one of them. It would be better if he could focus on just one area. If he had not spent so much time solving the wrong problem, his website might have been more successful. 
When I read the part "know your audience," I think it coincides with what we learned last semester in the Engineering Forum. In that class, we designed our own products and spent a lot of time talking with our potential customers. It made us realize how important it is to know who our audience are and what they want from us. 
One thing that I think I should improve is to "share and talk about it." Most of the time, I am a little shy to talk about my thoughts and ideas. In the end, I sometimes regret that I had missed a good chance to offer a good idea or get feedback from other people. So I will try my best to work on this problem, and talk more about my ideas.
